# Data-Bootcamp-Project

Data analysis project using Excel, PowerBI and Tableau

This project used a database of a company's employee data. The data was prepared and cleaned using Excel and then analysed using various formulas to answer business and financial questions such as "How much does the company need to make overall to cover the current salaries of it's employees", "How much does bonuses add to the salary cost?" and various other insights. Data visualisation was produced using excel, Power BI and Tableau.

### Q1. How much does the company need to make overall to cover the current salaries of its employees?
Solution using Excel: To cover all the current salaries of the employees (excluding bonus), the Company needs to make at least $14,100,110,721,276.00 to break even. To calculate this, all the salaries were added using the following formula:

=SUM(J7:J985)

To cover all the current salaries of the employees including bonus, the company needs to make at least $16,215,127,977,718.40 to break even. To calculate this, all the salaries plus bonus were added using the following formula:
